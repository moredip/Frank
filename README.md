Frank is an iPhone/iPad UI testing tool. It combines UISpec with an embedded HTTP server. This means it can be driven externally by cucumber for example. 

[Check out Frank in action!](http://sl.thepete.net/frank_ea_demo) This short screencast shows a sample iPhone app being exercised in the iPhone simulator by a set of cucumber tests.
