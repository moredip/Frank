Scenario: 
    Rotating the simulator for demonstration purposes
Given I launch the app

Given the device is in landscape orientation
And I pause briefly for demonstration purposes
Given the device is in portrait orientation
And I pause briefly for demonstration purposes
Given the device is in landscape orientation
And I pause briefly for demonstration purposes
Given the device is in portrait orientation
And I pause briefly for demonstration purposes
