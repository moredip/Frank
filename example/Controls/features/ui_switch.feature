Feature: 
				In order to write automated acceptance tests
				As a tester
				I want Frank to be able to automate UISwitches

				Background:
								#								Given I launch the app
								And I touch "UISwitch"

				Scenario: Flipping the switch off and on
								When I touch "the switch"

								#When I flip switch "the switch" on
								#Then I should see "Switch is on"
