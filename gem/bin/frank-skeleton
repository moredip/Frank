Frank subdirectory created.
Your next step is to create a Frankified target for your app, and add the libFrank.a and frank_static_resources.bundle files inside the Frank directory to that target.
After that, you can build the target and try executing 'cucumber' from the Frank directory to see how your initial cucumber test runs.
